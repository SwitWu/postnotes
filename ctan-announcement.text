## v0.2.4 (2023-06-12)

### Changed
- Use new `\lTblrMeasuringBool` for identifying measuring passes in
  `tabularray` tables.

### Fixed
- Don't inhibit `postnote` counter stepping in contexts which restore counter
  values in measuring passes to ensure proper measuring.
- Update User manual and regression tests for `l3kernel`'s renaming of
  `\bool_case_true:n(TF)` to `\bool_case:n(TF)`.
