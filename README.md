**Endnotes for LaTeX**

`postnotes` is an endnotes package for LaTeX.  Its user interface provides
means to print multiple sections of notes along the document, and to subdivide
them either automatically -- by chapter, by section -- or at manually
specified places, thus being able to easily handle both numbered and
unnumbered headings.  The package also provides infrastructure for setting up
contextual running headers for printed notes.  The default is a simple but
useful one, in the form "Notes to pages N--M", but more elaborate ones can
be built.  When `hyperref` is loaded, `postnotes` provides hyperlinked
notes, including back links.

The released version of this package is available [from CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/postnotes).
